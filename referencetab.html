<p>These are the different types of notes that you will see on a sheet of music. A whole note has one beat per measure. On the left side 
of a bar of music it may have numbers like 4 over 4 or may just have the letter C. C means common time meanin there are 4 beats per 
measure. Think of the song twinkle twinkle little stars, this song will have 4 beats/measure. Jin-gle bells-jin-gle-bells, each section
is a beat. The other types of notes are just 2x faster or even 16x faster. That is what the missing thing is at the end of the picture.

<p>A rest is very similar to notes themselves. As it's called, it is a rest in your music playing where you completely rid of all sound 
for a small amount of time.The different types of rests last for as long as one note of its name. A whole rest lasts as long as a whole note
, a quarter rest lasts as long as a quarter note and so on.

<p>Above are the most commonly used chords. Chords are just a combination of a couple notes. Practice these chords as often as possible 
and it's alawys great to learn more of them. The numbers are where your fingers go and if you recall the picture in the home page it shows
you which fingers have which numbers.
