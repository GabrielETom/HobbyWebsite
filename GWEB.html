	<h1>Guitar and Music Theory!</h1>
	
	<p>Have you always wanted to learn to play the guitar? This website will not 
	only teach you the basics of the guitar but it will also teach you the fundamentals
	of music theory. First I will run down the notes on a sheet of music, how the guitar 
	sets up those notes and how to play each note. Each string plays a different note. 
	Starting off with the lowest string in sound, the order is E, A, D, G, B, and another 
	E.</p>

	<p>On the guitar, these are the notes that are being played on each fret and string. 
	The musical alphabet goes from letters A-G and in between them you have sharp and flat 
	notes. A sharp note is defined wit the symbol # and a flat notes is defined with 
	something that looks like a lower case b. So on the guitar, the order is the same as 
	shown above.  
	</p>
	
	<p>These are the 9 main and most commonly used notes of music. E G B D F, A good way 
	to remember this, and the way I learned it is <q> Every Good Boy Does Fine </q>. This 
	is for the notes that are on the line. For the notes in between the lines, FACE, you 
	could just remember it as is.  
	</p>

	<p>When placing your fingers on the guitar neck you want to assign you fingers with 
	numbers as shown below. In the reference section you can learn guitar chords and the 
	numbers along the neck are what fingers you put on the corresponding fret and string.   
	</p>

	<p>Those are the basics of guitar. It may seem complicated but all it takes is effort 
	and practice and you'll go on to more advanced concepts soon. The music reference page
	will teach you more about reading music and will include an array of guitar positions 
	to learn and play around with.
